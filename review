Overall:
Glad to see you’re getting github working. Your CSS and HTML is spot on. Great work.

What looks good:

You were able to replicate the Nav across both pages.
You got the boxes separated out on the services page nicely.
Close to pixel-perfect!

Suggestions:
1.	Keep doing what you’re doing! Very nice work!
