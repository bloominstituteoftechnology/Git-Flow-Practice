# Git-Flow-Practice

## This project is designed for one to practice the Git Flow here at BloomTech. You will be able to follow along with [this great link](https://bloomtech.notion.site/bloomtech/BloomTech-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9) and use this assignment to demonstrate your ability to work within this flow. Follow the instructions for the Git Flow Without CodeGrade listed below to complete the assignment.

## Directions

- [ ] Create your own fork (copy) of this repository by clicking the Fork button in the top right of Github
- [ ] Clone (download) this repository onto your computer by using this command in your CLI: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-NAME/Git-Flow-Practice.git`
- [ ] Create a branch (version) by using this command in your CLI: `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
- [ ] Add your name to the list of names below these instructions
- [ ] Send your code to Github by using this set of commands in your CLI: `git add .`, `git commit -m "type a message in here explaining what you changed"`, and `git push`
- [ ] On GitHub, the grey "main" button opposite from the green "Code" button will show your named branch's version of code after refreshing the page
- [ ] Create a Pull Request through the top menu of the repository on GitHub; click the green New Pull Request button, then use your own student fork as the base to compare myuser/firstName-lastName to myuser/main. *DO NOT MERGE THE PULL REQUEST!*


## ADD your name to this list
- Steve Rogers
- Ryan Hamblin
- Anaiz Alfonso


### For a non-practice project, this would be when you would submit through Canvas; for this one, once you've added your name to the list and created a Pull Request you're done- no submission required!
