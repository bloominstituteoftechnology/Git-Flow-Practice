1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 

A block element starts on a new line and takes up the full space it's assigned (height, width, etc). 
Inline elements, stays in the same line and only takes up as much space as needed.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

It is an element with an absolute value relative to its nearest ancestor.  The position is based on the values of 
top, bottom, right, and left.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

 

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default, and 1 
   element that is display inline-block by default .

-3 elements displayed as block by default - <div> <h1> <footer>
-2 elements that are inline by default - <span> <img>
-1 elements that are inline-block by default - <button>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

The box model is used with design and layout to set the margin, border, padding, and content values. The box model allows
for a border to go around the elements. This can be problematic when it comes to a reactive design.The fix is to set the 
border box sizing value to "border-box".
