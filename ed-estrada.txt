Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements all stay together on one line on a page. Block elements render onto a new line on a page and take up that whole space.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    The element stays within specified peramters relative to its closest non-statically positioned ancestor.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Display block by default: div, li, p
    Display inline by default: a, button, textarea
    Display inline-block by default: button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    All html elements can be seen as a box which contains margin, border, padding, and its content. Content is the actual information that we see, like, for example, text.
    Padding gives space between the content and the border. Border goes around the content and padding. Margin makes space between the border and the next element.
    We make all elements respect the width given to them by giving them a width of 100%.
