Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements typically cause a line break to occur.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? An element that is absolutely positioned is fixed to the top, right, bottom or left and is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor that is not static.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? I think you would give it a margin of auto but type width: 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default. I only found 2 elements that are diplay block: address and body. The only element I found that is display inline by default is map. The element that is display inline-block by default I think is img.  
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? The box model is a term used for design and layout in CSS. It uses width, height, padding, margin and border to style elements in HTML.  Box-sizing: border-box is what I found as a fix to the box model. It adds padding and borders in an element's width so a natural box layout is applied to all elements.
