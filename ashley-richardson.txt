Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? An inline element will not start a new line and will only occupy the space it requires. A block element starts a new line and will occupy up to 100% of the space.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? The element is taken out of flow and the other elements appear to not exist. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?  N/a 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default :
•	Display block by default
o	Div
o	Header
o	Section
•	Display inline by default
o	Anchor
o	Span
•	Display inline-block by default: 
o	Image 
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? The box model sets boundaries (border, padding, width, and margin) around our content. The fix is to set the page to 62.5% width (I believe) and that way you can use ems and rems and they are perfect multipliers by 10 for spacing.
