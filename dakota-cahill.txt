Stretch Questions: 

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    An inline element does not cause a line break and does not use the entire width of a page by default and is bound by the opening and closing tag. 
    A block element does does a new line and will use the full width of the page. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and 
    has a line break before and after the element.  

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    This means it has an absolute or fixed position within it's containing block. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify offsets from 
    the edges of the element's containing block.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    You would specify all of the dimensions of the 'box model' in CSS - height, width, margin, border and padding. 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block by default - <div>, <p>, <ul>, inline by dafult - <span>, <a>, inline-block by default - <img> 

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    Every element in html takes up space that is refefred to as a box. The 'box' is what encapsulates the element and comprises five properties: content(actual element display
    content), padding(clears the area directly around the content), border( goes around the padding and content), margin(transparent area around the border).
    The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.  

Git stretch Research:
    Research and understand what a merge conflict is and how to resolve it: 
    
    A merge conflict is when combining code that has commits that are in conflict with one another and git cannot decide which to go with, and needs
    input to come to a resolution. You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub. These can only be resolved by manually 
    editting the files and making line changes. You can see merge conflict under pul;l requests and from there choose to resolve the conflicts.     

    You can only resolve merge conflicts on GitHub that are caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the 
    same file on different branches in your Git repository. For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the conflict locally on the command line.

    Research the Git commands pull, rebase, merge. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch:

    pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
    rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base tip
    merge - Join two or more development histories together

    Research the Git commands reset , revert, clean. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made:

    reset -  Reset current HEAD to the specified state
    revert - Revert some existing commits
    clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree
